# COMP310

## Intro
### Operating system history
* vaccum tubes
* trensitors and batch system
* ICs and multiprogramming
* Pesonal computer
* mobile computer

### Evolution
* first generation
    * computer cost milions
    * hard to operate and program
    * No need for OS just one operation at a time
    * Idle was very expensive
* Second generation
    * Operators fetche compilers and card decks to get job reade
    * Batch systems came up then to optimize processes.
    * Program where executed in batches and programing could now be done onfline allowing us to start subroutines that can be used
* Third Generation
    * Memory partition used so that we can run multiple jobs together. Seeming paralellism, the CPU swaps between jobs. 
* How
    * Move from maximizing computer utilisation using 100% of CPU at a time to ensure that no power is wasted
    * Personal computers have lead to user wait time to be low as user activity must be spread out leaving CPU iddle more

### Design Concerns:
| Personal/Embedded system        | Security, space management, power consumption |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Time-Sharing systemss           | Security, Response time, CPU scheduling       |
| Batch Systems (Super computers) | Maximize CPU usage                            |
