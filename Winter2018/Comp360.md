>$\sum_{n=0}^k2^n=2^{n-1}-1$
$S=(a_1,a_2,â€¦)$ a sequence of integers
E is the set of even numbers from 1 to n \
$A=\sum_{i \in E} a_i$
$S=(1,3,2,5,4)$
$A=8$

> $G=(V,E)$ an undirected graph Suppose for every edge uv a number $C_{uv}$ is assigned. \
What does the following statment mean?
$\exists c \ \forall u \in V \ \sum_{uv \in E} C_{uv}=c$ \
Their exist a number c such that for all verteces in V the sum of its edges will equal c

> $G=(V,E)$ an undirected graph with degree of every vertex is 10 then suppose to every vertex $v \in V$ a postive integer $a_v$ is assigned. If $\sum _{v\in V} a_v=5$ then $\sum_{u \in v} \sum_{w \in V,uw \in E} a_w=50$

### Ford_Fulkerson Algorithm
    Try to find s-t path that have not used their full capacity and push more flow.
    We must however make sure that the path we are going to 
    optimize can actually make use of the added flow down the line. 
    Idea is that for the edges that go in the opposit direction
    we substract the flow that is going in the opposit direction


1. Start from all zero flow
2. Find a path firm s-t such that the edges that are in the forward direction have unused capacity. The backward edges have strictly positive flow on them. Add one unit to the forward edges and substract one unit to the backward edges.

> Def: [Residual graph] given a flow netwok (G,s,t,{$C_e$})
>and a flow f on G, the residua graph $G_f$ is as follows
>1. Nodes are the same as G
>2. $\forall uv \in G \ f(u,v) < C_{uv}$ add the edge uv with residual capacity $C_{uv}-f(uv)$to $G_f$
>3. $\forall uv \in G$ with $f(uv)>0$ add the opposit edge vu with residual capacity $f(uv)$
 
```
Initially set f(e)=0 on every edge
Construct Gf
while (s-t path in Gf)
    {
        f'<- Augment (f,p) //using the path
        update f<-f'
        update Gf
    }    
Augment(f,p)
    {
        Find lowest of p (path), which is the smallest 
        residual capacity.
        add it to forward edges
        subtract to backward edges
    }
```
#### Correctness:
>Capacity condition is satisfied through the algorithm:
>
>Residual capacities are chosen so that updating with Augment(f,p) will never assign a number to an edge that is larger than its capacity or smaller than 0.

>Conservation condition $f^{in}(v)=f^{out}(v)$
>
>Case 1
>
>We add the new value to 2 forward edge then we add to $f^{in}(v)$ and to $f^{out}(v)$
>
>Case 2
>
> Backward edge for $f^{out}$ so nothing changes
>
>Case 3
>
> Same as case 2 but the other way arround
>
>Case 4
>
> We remove flow from both side so the $f^{in}$ decreases so does $f^{out}$

#### Terminate
    At every iteration the flow increases by at least one unit. It can never exceed the total sum of all the capacities.

#### Running Time
    Let K be the largest capacity n the number of verteces and m
    the number of edges.

    At most Km iterations for the while loop 
    Each iteration requires DFS so m+n
    Since we assumed that the graph is connected and every vertex is adjecent to at least one edge m is at least n/2 so we can just change it to n.
    Final running time is: O(Km^2)

>Def a cut in a flow network is a partition (A,B) of the verteces such that $s \in A$ and $t \in B$

>Def Capacity of this cut is the sum of the capacities of edges going from A to B
>Cap(AB)= $\sum_{uv \in E \ u \in A \ v \in B} C_{uv}$ 
>
> A network with n verteces has $2^{n-2}$ cuts

### MaxFlow problem continue 15/01/2018
>Recall: For a flow $f:E \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^+$ \
$val(f)= \sum_{su \in E} f(su)$

>Claim: for any s-t cut (A,B), $val(f)= f^{out} (A) - f^{in}(A)$
    
> $\sum_{u \in A} ((\sum_{uw \in E} f(uw))-(\sum_{vu \in E} f(vu)))$

    If e is an edge with both endpoints in B => f(e) is not in the sum. 
    else if e has both points in A => f(e) is in both sums so it adds up to 0.
    else e exist in both A and B => f(e) is either added or substracted in the sums so we are only accounting for flow in and out. 
    Why does vale(f) = f in of the sink?
        Pick B as being just the sink then there is no f 
        out had just f in

> Claim: let (A,B) be a cut f be a flow then $val(f) \leq Cap(A,B)$ \
> Proof: 
> val(f) = $f^{out} (A) - f^{in} (A) \leq f^{out} (A) \leq \sum_{u \in A,v \in B, uv \in E} C_{uv} = Cap(A,B)$

    So to summarize we can use cuts to check for optimality if we fined a cut that has a Cap value equal to the maxflow we have found then we cannot do better than that. 

### Proof of Ford-Falkerson finds optimal flow
    FF: starts with o flow and while we can find paths in the residual graph we augment(f,P) and update residual graph. 

    Consider the point where FFF terminates. Let A* be the set of the verteces that the algorithm can reach from s in the residual graph. Note that t will alwats be in B* as if we could reach t then we would have an s-t path. 
    If uv is an edge original network with u in A* and v in B* Cuv is saturated otherwise we would be able to include v in A. 
$f^{out}(A^*)= \sum_{u \in A^*,v \in B^*, uv \in E} C_{uv} = Cap(A^*,B^*), f^{in} (A^*)=0$ because otherwise we would have an edge in Gf that goes from A* to B*

We showed that at the end of the algorithm max flow is always found,
$Maxflow \leq Cap(A^*,B^*)=val(f)=MaxFlow$

    Problem: Given a flow network how can we find a min-cut? 
    Just run FF and find A* and B*
$val(f) \leq maxFlow \leq minCut \leq Cap(A^*,B^*)$ but $val(f)=Cap(A^*,B^*)$ so they are all equal.

### Theorem Min-cut max flow relationship
    For any flow network Max-Flow = min-cut
