### Basic knowledge
> $\log_2(n)$ => the number of bits required for an umber raised up 

>$\sum_{n=0}^k2^n=2^{n-1}-1$
$S=(a_1,a_2,â€¦)$ a sequence of integers
E is the set of even numbers from 1 to n \
$A=\sum_{i \in E} a_i$
$S=(1,3,2,5,4)$
$A=8$

> $G=(V,E)$ an undirected graph Suppose for every edge uv a number $C_{uv}$ is assigned. \
What does the following statment mean?
$\exists c \ \forall u \in V \ \sum_{uv \in E} C_{uv}=c$ \
Their exist a number c such that for all verteces in V the sum of its edges will equal c

> $G=(V,E)$ an undirected graph with degree of every vertex is 10 then suppose to every vertex $v \in V$ a postive integer $a_v$ is assigned. If $\sum _{v\in V} a_v=5$ then $\sum_{u \in v} \sum_{w \in V,uw \in E} a_w=50$

### Max flow proble
> Def: a flow network is a directed grapg $G=(V,E)$
> 1. Every edge e has a capacity $c_e \geq 0$
> 2. There is a source $s \in V$
> 3. The is a sink $t \in V \ t \neq s$
