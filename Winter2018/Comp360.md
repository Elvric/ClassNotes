### Basic knowledge
> $\log_2(n)$ => the number of bits required for an umber raised up 

>$\sum_{n=0}^k2^n=2^{n-1}-1$
$S=(a_1,a_2,â€¦)$ a sequence of integers
E is the set of even numbers from 1 to n \
$A=\sum_{i \in E} a_i$
$S=(1,3,2,5,4)$
$A=8$

> $G=(V,E)$ an undirected graph Suppose for every edge uv a number $C_{uv}$ is assigned. \
What does the following statment mean?
$\exists c \ \forall u \in V \ \sum_{uv \in E} C_{uv}=c$ \
Their exist a number c such that for all verteces in V the sum of its edges will equal c

> $G=(V,E)$ an undirected graph with degree of every vertex is 10 then suppose to every vertex $v \in V$ a postive integer $a_v$ is assigned. If $\sum _{v\in V} a_v=5$ then $\sum_{u \in v} \sum_{w \in V,uw \in E} a_w=50$

### Max flow problem
> Def: a flow network is a directed grapg $G=(V,E)$
> 1. Every edge e has a capacity $c_e \geq 0$
> 2. There is a source $s \in V$
> 3. The is a sink $t \in V \ t \neq s$ \
> Assumption: 
>* No edge enters the source
>* No edge leave the sink
>* All capacities are integers
>* There is at least one edge incident to every vertex. (Every vertex has at least one edge connected to it)

>Def: [flow] A flow is a function $f:E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ such that 
> 1. Capacity condition $\forall e \in E \ 0 \geq f(e) \geq c_e$
> 2. Conservation, flow is conserved $\forall u \in V \ u \neq s,t \ f(u) = \sum _{vu \in E} f^{in}(vu) = \sum_{uw \in E} f^{out}(uw)$
> 3. Value f = $\sum_{su \in E} f(su) = f(s)$

    Now Give a flow network find a flow largest possible value
