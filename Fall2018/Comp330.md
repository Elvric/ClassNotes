## Relations
Correspondance between elements fo two sets.
$$R \subseteq A \times B$$  
Not every element of A need to be related to anything in B. A given element of A could be related to exactly one element in B we gat a fonction  

### Equivalent Relation
A function is bijective the rest are all relations  
$$R \subseteq S \times S$$
then
$$\forall  \in S \ sRs \\
\forall s,t \in S \ sRt \implies tRs \\
\forall s,t,p \in S \ sRt $$

#### Example
$$ n \equiv m (mod -\  5) \ n,m \in N$$
Give an equivalent relation R, an equivalence class of an element x
$$ x \equiv {y | xRy}$$
